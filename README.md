# Cargo Generate Template

My personal [cargo generate](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate) template

Differences between this and `cargo new`:

-   README with name, description, and license information
-   MIT License with correct copyright year
-   Description, repository, and license added to package information in cargo.toml
-   Release profile modifications for slower compilation with smaller binary output

**Note:** This template uses has my name hardcoded in. If you are reading this and are not me, you should not use this template and instead should be making a fork with your own values.
